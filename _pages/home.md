Welcome to my personal homepage! I am currently working as an associate professor in  [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://math.gdut.edu.cn) of [Guangdong University of Techonology](https://www.gdut.edu.cn). My focus is on numerical methods for the Kohn--Sham equation and complex Langevin methods in quantum chromodynamics.

In the area of the Kohn-Sham equation, I am working on several aspects, including the design adaptive methods and high order methods for discretization, the development of orthogonality-free methods for the discretized problem, and the generation of quality initial guesses to reduce divergence issues related to nonlinearity.

Regarding complex Langevin methods in quantum chromodynamics, I has shown interest in the development of stabilization techniques. These approaches aim to prevent divergence and converge to the correct results obtained through these methods.
