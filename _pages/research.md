  <h4>Multi-mesh adaptive finite element method for Kohn--Sham equation</h4>

  I am currently engaged in research on the multi-mesh adaptive method. This is due to the distinct behaviors exhibited by the Hartree potential and wavefunctions, such as varying decay rates and different regularities surrounding the nuclei. As a result, placing them in the same finite element space may not be the most suitable approach. We
